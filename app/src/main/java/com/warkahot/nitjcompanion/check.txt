Failure is the most beautiful of all the good things that can ever happen to you. While you wonder about the opening statement of this post that negates years of your Earthly Experience, I must further draw its resemblance to a strict kindergarten teacher- Hard outside and softer to the core who would have been a monster to you in your school days only to see you grow up as a disciplined and civilised individual. It conditions you to take up bigger challenges in life, else, deters you from accepting assignments bigger than your worth, to protect you from the wrath of its unsatisfactory completion. True that I have gone through seemingly intolerable amount of pain due to it, but looking back from where I am, I realise that each opportunity that I missed has made me work towards a better one. Every relationship that I failed to maintain has lead me closer to my own self and through my transition from BUMPER to SUSHEEL KUMAR, CHIMPANZEE and finally, WIFI, it is the only thing that has remained to help me reap the best of my potential.\nSo what about all the pain that it caused?\nWell, the pain was generated by my own system. It was caused due to the internal misconception of Universal Knowledge owing to the feeling of superiority that we all have deep down.\nIn fact, there exists no failure that has the potential to damage you beyond death. So why change its due course in your arrogance only to make yourself weaker and kill yourself worrying about it?\nIts these failures that lead you from a girl/boy to a woman/man, its failure that keeps you working, motivated, yet struck down to Earth, and its these failures again, that makes Success taste so wonderful!

What makes you *Proud* of being an NITian?

I was bewildered at his response. On one hand, it was a matter of pride for me to be associated with the tag everyone expects so much of, while on the other an embarrassment to have let those expectations down.\nIt was the first time that we had stepped out of the campus confines with a project we had only worked on for a fewho\nurs.The test run of the LFR was positive and so were we for the event.\nWe performed well, not considerably though and had an opportunity to converse with the panelists.\n\n*You guys should have covered the IR sensors to protect them from external sources.*\nHe made the right point there. However, we had already taken care of that.\n*But sir, we have fixed our sensors below the Metal Casing. External Sources shouldn't be a problem in such an arrangement.*\nI snapped.\nHe smiled. I could see that we had made an impression.\n*Which college are you from?*\n*Sir, we are from NIT.*\n*NIT? Which one?*\n*NIT Jalandhar.*\nI could see the smile fading away with disappointment. \n*You guys made this! I didn't expect this from you. Your seniors that I have come across have made exceptional models.*\nIt did not take long for me to realise that we had let our brand down.\n*Sir, we had less time to prepare, So....*\nWe continued with our conversation for an hour or probably two more.\n\nThat day and the conversation in particular made me realise a few things.\n\nFirst, while in college, your tag will speak louder than you ever will and its not always advantageous. \nIf you have tag that distinguishes you from others of your league, people will have some obvious expectations and you have got to work hard to justify them.\nThis platform is called *Proud to Be an NITian.*\nTo me, It makes no sense at all to be proud of things you make no plausible use of. \nSo here's a choice before you.\nYou could either be a lazy retard, which is what you presently are, and continue to be proud of your Brand while being an embarrassment to your college or you could pursue what you want, work hard, achieve something and make the NITs proud of you.\n\nThe choice, well, is yours....

They all stared at the dark bony man as he concluded his speech. It was the induction time of literary society of the college and despite the *not so exciting* theme of the community, a large number of fucchas had assembled in the hall.\n\n*Last year, Ramola Ma'am from our Society got placed in her dream profile and Sagar Sir bagged a whooping 28 lpa offer from Morgan Stanley.*\n\nHe continued for a while, listing all the wonderful Offers the Society's Alumni had converted. Later, another guy from Third Year ascertained the role of one's communication skills during placements.\nThe objective was to lure students to join the institution's only literary cell so they too could be placed well like their seniors.\nAfter all, this is what literature does! It gets you placed!\nSo if you have been wondering why Shakespeare wrote *Romeo and Juliet* or why Paulo Coelho had the urge to write *The Fifth Mountain*, you now know why all these guys have been screwing themselves for centuries!\nYaa right, PLACEMENTS!\n\nMost and Arguably all of us chose our colleges with respect to this one factor called *Placements*, and that sure includes me!\nNo, its not wrong to aim for a job, but then where are other more relevant factors that should have been elaborated on before the mention of Job offers?\nWhere did the skills, education, passion, commitment and most importantly LITERATURE go?\nIts time for us to make an exodus. We must cease to be a seeker and try being a donor instead. Its time for us to let go of the conventional Indian mindset and set our goals based on our Inclinations and Dreams rather than on Monetary lines.\nIts time we dream big and justify this immense caliber we have been bestowed with.\nWhy work for Google when you can create its competitor working for your own self?\nWhy take up a banking job against your interests when you could be a Researcher and make the same sector pay for your intellectual property?\nAnd finally, Why join the literary group for placements when you could actually join Theatre to pursue your hobby!\nNo, I am not glorifying a particular sector, but compelling you to pursue what you wish rather than what the society has glorified.\nThe true pleasure of life is not associated with 95% in boards, IITs/NITs, Goldman Sachs/Microsoft or being what the society longs to be, but BEING THE PERSON YOU ARE!\nBe Yourself, Do what you love and Pursue the Field you can innovate in!\nAs of the Society and peers, never let your spirits down because of their conservative views!\nAs the Rap God himself says, and I know I a using this for the second time in an article,\n*Even if it sounds Corny, Never let anyone tell you, You ain't Beautiful*\n\nGo on Beautiful! ;)
